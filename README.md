Introduction to E-commerce with Express.js, React, and Mongoose
Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, encompasses the buying and selling of goods or services online. With the rapid expansion of the internet, e-commerce has become a significant driving force in the global economy, offering a convenient and efficient way for consumers to shop from the comfort of their homes.

Express.js, React, and Mongoose are powerful tools that can be combined to create a comprehensive e-commerce application. Express.js is a popular Node.js web application framework that provides a robust and flexible foundation for building e-commerce platforms. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive e-commerce experiences. Mongoose, an object-data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, facilitates seamless interactions with a NoSQL database, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of e-commerce data.

This project aims to showcase the development of an e-commerce application using Express.js, React, and Mongoose. It will cover essential aspects of building an e-commerce platform, including:

User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user registration, login, and access control mechanisms using Express.js middleware and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Product Management: Create, edit, and manage product listings using Express.js routes and controllers, integrated with the Mongoose ODM for data persistence.

Order Processing: Handle customer orders using Express.js routes and controllers, integrating with a payment gateway for secure transactions.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Implement a shopping cart system using React state management and local storage persistence.

Interactive User Interface: Build a user-friendly and interactive e-commerce interface using React components, leveraging its component-based architecture and declarative programming paradigm.

Throughout this project, you will gain practical experience in building a real-world e-commerce application using Express.js, React, and Mongoose. You will learn how to combine these technologies effectively to create a functional, user-friendly, and scalable e-commerce platform.
